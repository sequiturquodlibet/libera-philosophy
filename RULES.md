## About ##philosophy on libera.chat

**Channel Scope:**
The bread-and-butter of ##philosophy is the [traditional academic discipline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_philosophy):

 - [Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics)
	 - The branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space.
 - [Aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics)
	 - The theory or philosophy of beauty, closely associated with the [value of art](https://iep.utm.edu/value-of-art/).
 - [Epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology)
	 - The theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope.
	 - The investigation of what distinguishes justified belief from opinion.
 - [Axiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology)
	 - The study of the nature of value and valuation, and of the kinds of things that are valuable.
 - [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_logic)
	 - The study of correct reasoning. It includes both [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Formal_logic) and [informal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic#Informal_logic) logic.

*These* topics are always welcome. However, we realize many users aren't very familiar with formal philosophy and we don't want to exclude them. So conversations on a wide variety of adjacent topics are acceptable, for example: literature, history, and social sciences. ##philosophy approaches these in the spirit of philosophy -- that is, a good-faith exploration of ideas, as opposed to technical minutiae or polemics.

**Ground Rules:**
In keeping with the spirit of philosophy, we ask that you refrain from bad-faith interactions with other users. Examples of such interactions include: name-calling, strawman arguments, and bullying tactics.

Please avoid soapboxing -- that is, habitually using ##philosophy to promote your pet ideas without engaging in any following critical examination of those pet ideas. While it's fine to have a specific area of interest, "beating dead horses" stifles productive inquiry.

Topics will not be curtailed merely because they are controversial or unpopular - as long as the conversation proceeds in good faith. However, please avoid political talk regarding recent news items, or at minimum try reframe such talk in an abstracted, philosophical way, so that others can engage with you. ##philosophy is not a proper venue for partisanship.

Occasional social chit-chat is fine as long as it doesn't dominate more topical conversations. We invite you to take extended off-topic discussions to ##philosophy-off.

**Other guidelines:**

As a courtesy to other users reading the scrollback in their chat clients, please make an effort to condense your messages into a reasonable amount of lines (i.e. no hitting the return key after every second or third word in a sentence). You may also find that taking the time to type out out longer lines improves the quality of your writing - and thinking!

Extended discussions about theology, religious practices, personal spirituality, etc. are welcome in our sister channel, ##religion.
